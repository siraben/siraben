### 👋 Hi! I'm Ben.
- 🎓 BS in Computer Science and Honors Math, Vanderbilt ’23; MS in Computer Science, Yale ’25.
- 🥰 I'm currently obsessed with tree-sitter, eBPF, build systems, and foundation models.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about machine learning, distributed systems and cybersecurity.
- 🙌 I'm looking to collaborate on formal verification efforts and developer tooling for new and existing languages.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with organizing and developing mathematical theories in Rocq.
- 💬 Ask me about blockchain (Ethereum, Bitcoin), mathematics, type systems and compilers for functional and imperative languages.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an email, or reach me on Matrix (siraben)!
