### 👋 Hi! I'm Ben.
- 📚 I study CS and math at Vanderbilt University.
- 🔭 I'm currently working on:
  - Improving the number of available packages in Nixpkgs on macOS.
  - Working through [Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html).
- 🥰 I'm currently obsessed with tree-sitter, eBPF and build systems.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about machine learning, software verification, logic and distributed computing.
- 🙌 I'm looking to collaborate on formal verification efforts and developer tooling for new and existing languages.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with organizing and developing mathematical theories in Coq.
- 💬 Ask me about blockchain (Ethereum, Bitcoin), mathematics, type systems and compilers for functional and imperative languages.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an email, or reach me on Matrix (siraben)!
