### 👋 Hi! I'm Ben, a Math/CS undergraduate at Vanderbilt University.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on:
  - Improving the number of available packages in Nixpkgs on macOS.
  - Working through [Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about measure theory, group theory and connections between category theory and functional programming.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on large scale functional programming projects and formal verification efforts.
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with organizing and developing mathematical theories in Coq.
- 💬 Ask me about blockchain (Ethereum, Bitcoin), recursion schemes, type systems and compilers for functional and imperative languages.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an email, or reach me on IRC (siraben)!
